# [Runescape Goals](http://www.runescapegoals.com)
An online tool to generate fun tasks to complete in the game 'Old School Runescape'.

## Why?
Often, whilst playing Runescape, I'll get bored of the grind of doing a single task. Runescape was most fun for me whilst playing with a group of friends, running into random activities . This tool aims to give you goals - some serious,  some outlandish - to work towards.

## Can I help?
YES!. The app currently works, we are in alpha at the moment. The biggest thing stopping progress is the lack of Data. We need to create, maintain and update our JSON files to give players tasks.

You might not be a coder, or you might be brand new to github, but it's very easy to contribute and help us out!.


## Contributing:
Getting involved is easy. You will need a basic understanding of VUE and Github.
Runescpape-Goals uses the [VUE CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/) -  This means you will need both [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) & [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) locally installed
